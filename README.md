This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Stripe test integration

This is a simple Stripe integration with the create-react-app boilerplate and Express.

## Getting started:

1. ### `npm install`
We first install all dependencies.


2. ### `node server.js`
Start local server when in the stripe-integration directory. `server.js` is located in `/stripe-integration`. Our server will listen locally on port 8080 for requests.


3. ### `npm start`
Run the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
